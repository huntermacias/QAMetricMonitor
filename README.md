## Contributing 
1. Clone this project
2. Verify node is installed and also a package manager. I use npm but you can use bun or yarn or pnpm
3. Run `npm install` or `npm i` for short
4. Run `npm run dev` to boot up application
5. Navigate to `localhost:3000`


## Installing packages
Note: I haven't udpated the next.js version, so if you are trying to install a package you might get an error. For example if you're trying to install axios you would typically run `npm i axios` or `npm installl axios` however if this gives you an error then you can run `npm i axios --force` 
- this is just a temp. workaround until the `package.json` versions are updated
